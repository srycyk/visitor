  <p class='text-muted'>
    Keeps a record of sites to revisit,
    allowing you to easily bring them back up in tabs.

  <p class='text-muted'>
    You can import your current bookmarks from Firefox or Chrome.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    Alternatively, you can manually fill-in URL's, in the Bookmark
    entry form - one at a time.
    Or, simply as plain text, in the Import entry form - many at once.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    Bookmarks are always stored under a tag, or folder,
    of your own choosing.
    <em>
      Tags are created for you on an import, otherwise, you must
      create one before you're able to fill-in any site addresses.
    </em>
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    A tag consists of a simple name, which is a label or category.
    Some examples of a tag, might be <em>rugby-league</em>,
    <em>etruscan-pottery</em> or
    <em>knitting</em>.
    Tags can be nested in a tree-like structure.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    Through the <em>Export</em> link,
    you can download a CSV file of your bookmarked sites
    for backups or sharing. On the <em>Import</em> page,
    you can upload this file.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    Your bookmarked pages can be changed, moved about, and deleted.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    Once registered,
    you can forever delete everything to do with your account
    - if you don't want to continue to use the service.
  </p>
  <p class='text-muted'>
    A site like this has become more useful lately,
    as too many sites have JavaScript leaks and hangs,
    which, if left open in a tab,
    can slow down everything else.
